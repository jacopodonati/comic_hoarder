`ch` is a simple utility to download comics from the web. As of today (2024-02-06), it supports these sources:

- GoComics
- xkcd

It can download either one comic, the last _n_ comics, or all comics. Some features are still missing, like spacing the downloads, predefined settings, etc.

Drop an issue to suggest a new feature or a new source.
